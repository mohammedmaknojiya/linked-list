there are two methods

#https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-loop-in-a-linked-list/

1- use hash map to store all visited node 
and every time we check that our current node is there in the hash or not 
if yes then its loop
here time and space both are O(n)

this method will not work for repeated elements in the list



2- use floyds method 

for explaination see video in article

isma ham 2 pointer p and q ka use karta hai 
p ki speed 1 hai means wo ek step sa hamehsa aga badha ga
q ki speed 2 hai means wo hamesha 2 step sa aga badha ga


according to this algo agar ek ki speed dusra sa double hai and LOOP PRESENT HAI then definetly they will meet at one point.
