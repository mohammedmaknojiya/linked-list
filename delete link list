In Java, automatic garbage collection happens, so deleting a linked list is easy. We just need to change head to null.

In python and other language it is not the case

refer prog


while curr ---> null:
  
  next=curr-->next
  del curr-->data
  curr=next
  
  
repeat till we reach null means end of list
