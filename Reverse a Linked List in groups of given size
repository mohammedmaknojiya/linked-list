you can do it by above method in O(N) time and O(1) extra space

but if you want to use stack concept then space becomes O(K)

where k is the group size for reversing 

because stack size is that much of the group size

explaination

means usna pehla ek empty stack liya 
then usme agar k=3 hai tab 3 element dala
then ab usna 1 ele ko pop kiya 
usko node me conert kiya kyu ki wo as a int list me store tha
now ab usna prev var ko check kiya 
agar wo none hai to prev=node and head=prev
isi trah wo prev and head ko update karta gaya and end me usna head ka addr return kardiya
