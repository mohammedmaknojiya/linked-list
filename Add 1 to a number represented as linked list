let number = 1999 
then when we add 1 it becomes 2000

now linked list is 1---9---9----9--null

now because add is done from left most bit hence we reverse the linked list

9---9----9----1---null

now we traverse the list node by node and add 1 

now if nodedata+1 >=10:
hence we have to update the node data to 0 and carry =1 

now agar no aisa hai 1998
then after reverse wo 8--9---9---1--null   hojaya ga

now 8+1=9 not greater than or equal to 10 hence we stop the loop break and we simply return 1999 by applying reverse

but jab tak carry ata jaya ga tab tak ham traverse karta jaya ga

now ab aisa case bhi hosakta hai ki linked list 99 +1 ki ho tab


9-----9-----null

step 1

9+1>=10  
sum vlaue = sum % 10    hence carry=1

node--data = sum value

step 2
9+1>=10  
sum vlaue = sum % 10    hence carry=1

node--data = sum value

now after completing the linked list carry is still 1  because 99+1=100 
2 digit converted to three digit hence we have to add one node
at the end of linked list 

hence make node = carry value , None

at this thing at the end of linked list and reverse that
