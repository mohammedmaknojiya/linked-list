We know that Floydâ€™s Cycle detection algorithm terminates when fast and slow pointers meet at a common point.
We also know that this common point is one of the loop nodes (2 or 3 or 4 or 5 in the above diagram). 
We store the address of this common point in a pointer variable say ptr. 
Then we initialize a counter with 1 and start from the common point and keeps on visiting next node and increasing the counter 
till we again reach the common point(ptr). At that point, the value of the counter will be equal to the length of the loop.
